## 🧩 About

**CalmQuest** is a mindfulness and mental wellness app that transforms stress management into an interactive adventure. Users receive mood-aware quests tailored to their current mood, energy, and available time.  
The goal is to make mindfulness **approachable, personalized, and consistent.**

---

## 🎯 Problem

Modern life brings constant stress — academic pressure, workplace burnout, and digital fatigue.  
Most wellness apps feel repetitive, impersonal, or hard to stick with. As a result, users often lose motivation and stop maintaining healthy mindfulness habits.

---

## 💡 Solution

CalmQuest introduces **gamification** and **personalized recommendations** to make stress management engaging and sustainable.  
By rewarding consistency and visualizing emotional growth through XP, badges, and achievements, CalmQuest helps users form and maintain healthy self-care routines.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Mood-Based Quests:** Daily activities adapted to a user’s mood, time availability, and energy.  
- **Guided Breathing & Meditation:** Short, accessible exercises for quick stress relief and focus.  
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual dashboards that show XP, levels, and milestone achievements.  
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Adaptive suggestions based on mood logs and past engagement.  
- **Notifications & Streaks:** Gentle reminders and streak tracking to encourage consistency.  
- **Achievements & Rewards:** Badges and level-ups to make progress visible and motivating.  
- **Privacy-First Approach:** Clear controls for data export/delete and minimal required data collection.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Conceptual)

1. User records mood and available time.  
2. The quest engine proposes one or more short activities tailored to that combination.  
3. Completing activities grants XP and contributes to streaks and achievements.  
4. Recommendation logic adapts over time to prioritize activities that improve engagement and well-being.

---

## 🕹️ Gamification Model (Example)

- **XP** for completed quests (scaled by duration/difficulty)  
- **Level Progress** based on cumulative XP  
- **Streak Multipliers** for consecutive days of completion  
- **Badges** for milestones (e.g., 7-day streak, consistent mood improvement)  
- **Personalized Evolution**: Quest suggestions evolve with user behavior

---

## 🧭 User Flow

1. **Sign Up / Log In**  
2. **Set Preferences** (daily notification window, typical session length)  
3. **Log Mood** (quick selection)  
4. **Receive a Tailored Quest**
