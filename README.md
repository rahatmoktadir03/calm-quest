## ⚙️ How It Works (Conceptual)

1. User records mood and available time.  
2. The quest engine proposes one or more short activities tailored to that combination.  
3. Completing activities grants XP and contributes to streaks and achievements.  
4. Recommendation logic adapts over time to prioritize activities that improve engagement and well-being.

## 🕹️ Gamification Model (Example)

- **XP** for completed quests (scaled by duration/difficulty)  
- **Level Progress** based on cumulative XP  
- **Streak Multipliers** for consecutive days of completion  
- **Badges** for milestones (e.g., 7-day streak, consistent mood improvement)  
- **Personalized Evolution**: Quest suggestions evolve with user behavior
