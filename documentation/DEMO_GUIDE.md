## 💡 Demo Best Practices

### Before Demo

1. Clear browser localStorage to start fresh
2. Test the full flow once
3. Have backup browser window open
4. Prepare a 1-minute "demo quest" path

### During Demo

- **Tell a story**: "Imagine Sarah, stressed after work..."
- **Highlight unique value**: Compare to Calm, Headspace (boring, no engagement)

### Handling Questions

- **"What makes this different?"** → Gamification drives retention
- **"Is there data?"** → "We're focusing on MVP validation first"
- **"Backend?"** → "Currently localStorage, Supabase integration planned"
- **"Monetization?"** → "Freemium: Premium quests, analytics, social features"

3. **Limited quest variety** - 12 quests (easy to expand)
4. **No analytics dashboard** - coming next sprint
5. **Single-player only** - no social features yet

**Frame as strengths**: "We focused on nailing the core loop first"
